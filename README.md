## Description

Another project in my summer of React! This is an API-based web application that I decided to make to get more familiar with the framework. A lot of the functionality is based on asynchronous, obviously, and hooks. A great project because I love to cook! I typically deploy my projects to GH pages but this time I'm going to push it to Firebase because I want experience with it.

You can view the project [âš“here](https://recipe-app-react-18098.web.app/) (I would recommend view on mobile as responsive isnt optimized for larger screen sizes)!
